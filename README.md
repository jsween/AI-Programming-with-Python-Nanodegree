[Project 1: Implement Image Classifier](https://github.com/jsween/AI-Programming-with-Python-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project-1-Image-Classifier-Dogs)

In this project, I tested my Python coding skills by using a trained image classifier. I used the trained neural network to classify images of dogs (by breeds) and compared the output with the known dog breed classification.
